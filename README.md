# GeneBody benchmark - A-NeRF: Articulated Neural Radiance Fields for Learning Human Shape, Appearance, and Pose

GeneBody Benchmark reivison of the implementation of paper "A-NeRF: Articulated Neural Radiance Fields for Learning Human Shape, Appearance, and Pose", NeurIPS 2021. This repository borrows most of the code from the [original implementation](https://github.com/LemonATsu/A-NeRF).



## Installation
The code is tested with Python3.8, PyTorch == 1.9.0 and CUDA == 10.2. We recommend you to use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to make sure that all dependencies are in place. To create an anaconda environment:
```
conda create -n anerf python=3.8
conda activate anerf

# install pytorch for your corresponding CUDA environments
pip install torch

# install pytorch3d: note that doing `pip install pytorch3d` directly may install an older version with bugs.
# be sure that you specify the version that matches your CUDA environment. See: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d
pip install pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py38_cu102_pyt190/download.html

# install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare datasets
Please download the GeneBody *Test10* subset from Onedrive [link](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wchengad_connect_ust_hk/EgWKPko5WXdClIg_zsjDSxwBH7LM4waKyJkWaslC-BVfSQ?e=JaDZdQ), and the dataset is organized as below.
```
├──data/
├───genebody_origin/
  ├───amanda
  ├───barry

then cd in core, run python load_genebody.py --subject amanda --split train
then you can get the train data h5 file of amanda, and you can change the subject and split to get the rest h5 files, final data structure is like this:   

├──data/
├───genebody/
  ├───amanda_train.h5/
  ├───amanda_test.h5/
  ├───barry_train.h5/
  ├───barry_test.h5/
```

### 2. Train GeneBody
To train on GeneBody sequence, eg. `amanda`, you can run  
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/genebody/genebody.txt --subject amanda --basedir logs --expname GeneBody_amanda --no_reload
```

### 3. Evaluation
To evaluate our pretrained models on Genebody, run:
```
python run_render.py --nerf_args config/genebody/genebody.txt --ckptpath logs/genebody_amanda/150000.tar --dataset genebody --entry amanda --render_type val --render_res 512 512  --runname genebody_test_amanda
```

### 4. Result in GeneBody sequence:

| jinyutong | 12.649 | 0.412 | 0.250 |
| joseph_matanda | 9.233 | 0.298 | 0.362 |
| maria | 12.406 | 0.50 | 0.119 |
| soufianou_boubacar_moumouni | 19.70 | 0.578 | 0.202 |
| Average | 15.5661 | 0.5075 | 0.2419 |

A-Nerf's performance in some cases are bad, and can barely render realistic image in most unseen pose.
